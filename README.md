## macOS Post-Install Scripts for Dell G7-7588 Laptop

Big thanks to RehabMan for all the scripts, tools, kexts, and ssdt patch templates that he made. All of the scripts and tools used here are borrowed from RehabMan's repo [here](https://github.com/RehabMan/Lenovo-Y50-DSDT-Patch) and [here](https://github.com/RehabMan/hack-tools) with some modifications to fit this laptop needs.

This set of patches/makefile can be used to patch your Dell G7-7588 DSDT/SSDTs.  There are also post install scripts that can be used to create and install the kexts the are required for this laptop.
